                    Elizabeth Woolridge Grant (born June 21, 1985), known professionally as Lana Del Rey, is an
                    American singer, songwriter, record producer, poet and music video director. Her music has been
                    noted by critics for its stylized cinematic quality; its preoccupation with themes of tragic
                    romance, glamour, and melancholia; and its references to pop culture, particularly 1950s and
                    1960s Americana.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Del Rey possesses an expansive contralto vocal range, which spans three-plus octaves and has been
                    described as captivating and highly emotive, ranging from high notes in a girlish timbre to jazzy
                    ornaments in her lower gesture with great ease. Following the release of Ultraviolence, which was
                    recorded live in single takes and lacking Pro Tools vocal editing, critics fell into favor with
                    Del Rey's vocal ability, praising her large range, increased vocal confidence, and uniquely emotive
                    delivery. When recording in the studio Del Rey is known for vocal multi-layering, which, as it has
                    been noted, is difficult for her to replicate within a live setting, especially with the lack of
                    backing singers to fill out the original vocal style.[248] Stage fright has also been noted as a
                    major contribution to Del Rey's struggles with live performances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Born in New York City and raised in Upstate New York, Del Rey returned to New York City in 2005, to
                    embark on her music career. Following numerous projects including her debut studio album and the
                    unreleased Sirens, Del Rey's breakthrough came after the viral success of her debut single
                    "Video Games" in 2011. She then signed with Interscope and Polydor later that year. Her major label
                    debut Born to Die (2012) proved an international success and spawned her first top-ten single on the
                    Billboard Hot 100 with the Cedric Gervais remix of "Summertime Sadness", as well as the internationally
                    successful singles "Blue Jeans", "Born to Die", and "National Anthem". Del Rey released the
                    Grammy-nominated EP, Paradise in 2012. The next year, Del Rey ventured into film as she wrote, directed
                    and starred in the short music film, Tropico, and released "Young and Beautiful" for the film The Great
                    Gatsby.

                    Born to Die is the second studio album and major label debut by American singer-songwriter Lana Del
                    Rey. It was released on January 27, 2012 by Interscope Records and Polydor Records. Del Rey collaborated
                    with producers including Patrik Berger, Jeff Bhasker, Chris Braide, Emile Haynie, Justin Parker, Rick
                    Nowels, Robopop and Al Shux to achieve her desired sound.

                    After attaining online success after its initial premiere on June 29, 2011, "Video Games" was released as
                    the lead single from Born to Die on October 7, 2011; it peaked at number ninety-one on the US Billboard Hot
                    100. Its follow-up singles "Born to Die", "Off to the Races", "Blue Jeans", "Summertime Sadness", "National
                    Anthem", and "Dark Paradise" achieved varying levels of success. French producer Cedric Gervais' remix of
                    "Summertime Sadness" was released on July 11, 2013 and became Del Rey's highest-charting single in the
                    United States, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100. Del Rey promoted Born to Die with several
                    televised performances, including a widely criticized appearance on Saturday Night Live. The album was
                    reissued on November 9, 2012 as an expanded version subtitled The Paradise Edition, which was packaged
                    with Del Rey's third extended play Paradise (2012). Born to Die has sold 7 million copies worldwide as of
                    June 2014.

                    As of January 2018, Born to Die is one of only three albums released by a female artist to have spent more
                    than 300 weeks on the Billboard 200 chart and the second longest charting album for a female artist
